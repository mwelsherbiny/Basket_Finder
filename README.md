Basket Finder is a mobile app that aims at solving the problem of littering by providing users with accessible information about where the nearest garbage basket is

## Features

- Users are provided with a map that includes all the locations for nearby garbage baskets
- A road is drawn between the user's current position and the nearest location to guide them to it
- Users can add a location for each garbage basket they find
- Community-driven moderation system, where users decide which locations are valid and which aren't
- Locations that are not found my multiple users are removed from the map
- Credibility system that rewards users who add valid locations and penalizes users that don't
- A filter so users can select what type of locations are shown on the map(likely to find, unconfirmed, unlikely to find)
- Google authentication for easy user verification
